Xamarin projects, templates, and examples using the Flux Pattern.

The Flux pattern is a design pattern and client architecture focused on the flow of data. It was developed and designed by Facebook:

Be sure to check out the Flux toolkit for more easily building your own flux apps here: https://github.com/suavepirate/fluxtoolkit

It was designed to solve issues with scaling out large code bases and data sets by forcing unidirectional data flows and trickle down events and bindings.
